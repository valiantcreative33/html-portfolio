                <p><strong>Hello!</strong> Welcome to the web and design portfolio of <strong>Ruben Matamoros</strong>. 
                I am a highly motivated Graphic & Web Designer with over eight years of experience in developing engaging and innovative digital and print designs for clients in a broad range of industries. 
                Additionally, I am currently taking a coding boot camp at UCF to broaden my skills in the software engineering industry as a FullStack Developer.

                <p>
                    Originally, I hail from the tropical land of Costa Rica, although, I grew up mostly here in the USA and now reside in Tampa Bay, Florida. I graduated at the top of my class in 2013 from Full Sail University as the Advanced Achiever, and since then I have designed on a global scale with companies such as Ashley Furniture and Carillon Tower Advisors of Raymond James. Additionally, I am currently taking a coding boot camp at UCF to broaden my skills in the software engineering industry as a FullStack Developer. 
                </br></br>When I’m not sketching and crushing pixels I enjoy being active as well after sitting all day. My favorite sports are martial arts, soccer, and bike riding. What I enjoy most of all is traveling and spending time with my beautiful wife and three daughters.
